Rave Painter
=========================

A small application developed in Processing while trying to get familiar with the environment. Inspired by the "Sonic Painter" tutorial application presented in week 1 of the the "Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps" MOOC on Coursera (https://class.coursera.org/digitalmedia-003).
